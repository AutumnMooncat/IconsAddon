# Shadow Siren Mod

_**aka Vivian The Spire**_


This mod currently adds Vivian from the game Paper Mario - The Thousand-Year Door.

Alongside her is a full suite of 80+ cards that are not guaranteed to play well with other mods. I did my best. While I do not yet know of any incompatibilities, please let me know if you find any.

All assets are from Paper Mario - TTYD and are property of Nintendo and their respective owners. 

This mod is a work in progress, but it is still a fully playable (if not balanced) experience at the moment.

Features

_**Stances:**_ 
Vivian has 5 different stances to play around. As she only has 40 base HP, utilizing these defensive stances will be paramount to survival in the spire.

_Veil_ - A purely defensive stance that halves damage taken but also halves damage dealt. You start with access to this stance every run.

_Abyss_ - A supportive/defensive stance where you can draw many cards and gain Block at the end of your turn. Debuffs are easier to apply in this stance as well.

_Smoke_ - A defensive stance where all cards retain and damage taken is reduced based on the number of cards in your hand. Reducing damage in this way will discard all of your cards however!

_Huge_ - A purely offensive stace where all Attack cards deal double damage. As a downside, you lose 1 Energy after playing Attack cards, so make sure not to neglect your defences unless you can secure the kill.

_Hyper_ - A all-rounder stance that has no downsides. You deal additional damage and take less damage in this stance, and leaving this stance gives you charge. This is the hardest stance to get access to.

_**Buffs / Debuffs:**_
Vivian has interacting elemental-style debuffs, as well as other debuffs designed to synergize with her stances.

_Charge - Buff_ - Your next Attack and/or Block is 50% more effective per stack of Charge. Electric Application increased by 1 per stack of Charge.

_Vigor - Buff_ - While part of basegame, it is slightly modified for this mod. Both damage _and_ Burn application is increased by 1 per stack of Vigor.

_Electric - Buff_ - Acts similar to a combination of Thorns and Strength. When attacking, a secondary hit equal to your Electric is made. When attacked, the attacker takes damage equal to your Electric as well.

_Chill/Freeze - Debuff_ - Once enough Chill is applied to a target, said target is Frozen. Frozen targets are invincible, but stunned for a turn (unable to act). Stacking additional Freeze increases the amount of turns the target is unable to act for.

_Burn - Debuff_ - Burn is a turn-based power which causes a target to lose HP equal to the number of debuffs it has at the end of the round.

_Drench - Debuff_ - Has no effect on its own, but interacts with the previous 3 elemental attacks. Applying Burn to a Drenched target causes a Steam Explosion, Drench accelerates Chill application, and Drench increases damage dealt by Electric.

_Hexed - Debuff_ - A Hexed target takes damage equal to their Hex every time they successfully attack. If the target does not attack, Hex is halved. Will activate multiple times for multi-hit attacks.

_Soft - Debuff_ - A Soft target takes 3 additional damage from attacks. Applied after all other modifiers.

_Dizzy - Debuff_ - A Dizzy target has a 50% chance to miss their attack, accomplishing nothing. A missed attack does not count as a successful attack, and will not trigger any "On Attack" effects.

_Confused - Debuff_ - A Confused target has a 50% chance to either attack themselves or an ally. A redirected attack is still a successful attack, assuming it does not also miss.
